In Clean Architecture, the infrastructure layer includes all of the technical details of the application 
such as the database, file storage, networking, and other infrastructure-specific implementations. 
This layer communicates with the outer layers (such as the use case or presentation layers) 
via interfaces, which allows the outer layers to remain unaware of the specific infrastructure 
technologies being used.

Examples of things you can place inside infrastructure in clean architecture are :

Database : Repository implementation, query data and map data to entities
File storage: Implement reading and writing file to the filesystem
Networking: Implementing http calls and api clients
Push Notifications : send/receive push notifications.
Logging : Send log data to a logging service.
It is important to keep the infrastructure layer as thin as possible, so that it is easy to test and 
replace with different implementations.
