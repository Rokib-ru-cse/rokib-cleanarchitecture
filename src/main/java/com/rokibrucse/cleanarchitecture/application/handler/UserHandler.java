// To summarize, the main difference between the handler and service packages is the purpose they serve within the architecture. 
// The handler package is responsible for handling incoming requests and returning responses, while the service package is 
// responsible for implementing the business logic of the application.




// Each handler class in the handler package should define methods for handling specific requests and returning a response to the client. 
// For example, a UserHandler class might have methods for creating a new user, updating an existing user, 
// or retrieving a list of users. The handler class should coordinate with the appropriate service or component in the application or domain layers to carry out the requested action and return the result to the client.

// It's important to note that the handler classes should not contain any business logic themselves. 
// Their role is to act as an intermediary between the client and the business logic, ensuring that requests are properly formatted and responses are properly returned. 
// This separation of concerns allows the business logic to remain independent of the infrastructure
