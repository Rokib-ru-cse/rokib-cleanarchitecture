// Each class in the persistence package should implement the corresponding interface defined in the domain layer's 
// repository package. For example, the UserRepositoryImpl class might implement the UserRepository interface, 
// providing concrete implementations for methods such as create(), update(), and findById(). 
// These classes contain the code for accessing and manipulating data in the database or other data storage system, 
// and are responsible for translating between the data model used by the database and the domain model used by the business logic.
// It's important to note that the classes in the persistence package should not contain any business logic. 
// Their role is to provide concrete implementations for the interfaces defined in the domain layer, 
// and to handle the details of storing and retrieving data from the database or other data storage system. 
// This separation of concerns allows the business logic to remain independent of the infrastructure.
