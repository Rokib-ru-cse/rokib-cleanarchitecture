// Each service class in the service package should define methods for performing specific business actions and 
// interacting with the domain layer. For example, a UserService class might have methods for creating a new user, 
// updating an existing user, or retrieving a list of users. The service class should coordinate with the appropriate 
// component in the domain layer to carry out the requested action and return the result to the caller.

// It's important to note that the service classes should not contain any infrastructure-specific code, 
// such as code for accessing a database or calling a web service. Their role is to implement the business 
// logic of the application and delegate to the domain layer for any data access or manipulation. 
// This separation of concerns allows the business logic to remain independent of the infrastructure.



// The handler package typically contains classes that handle incoming requests and delegate to the appropriate service or 
// component in the application or domain layers to carry out the requested action. The handler classes act as an intermediary 
// between the client and the business logic, ensuring that requests are properly formatted and responses are properly returned. 
// They do not contain any business logic themselves, but rather delegate to the appropriate service or component to perform the 
// requested action and return the result.The service package, on the other hand, typically contains classes that implement the 
// business logic of the application. The service classes define methods for performing specific business actions and interacting 
// with the domain layer. They contain the core business logic of the application and coordinate with the appropriate component in 
// the domain layer to carry out the requested action and return the result.To summarize, the main difference between the handler 
// and service packages is the purpose they serve within the architecture. The handler package is responsible for handling incoming 
// requests and returning responses, while the service package is responsible for implementing the business logic of the application.
